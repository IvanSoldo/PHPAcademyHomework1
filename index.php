                <h2>Calculators</h2>
                <p><em><b>Calculator</b></em>, machine for automatically performing arithmetical operations and certain
                    mathematical
                    functions. Modern calculators are descendants o
                    f a digital arithmetic machine devised by Blaise Pascal in 1642. Later in the 17th century,
                    Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz created a more-advanced machine,
                    and, especially in the late 19th century, inventors produced calculating machines that were smaller
                    and smaller and less and less laborious to use.
                    In the early decades of the 20th century, desktop adding machines and other calculating devices were
                    developed. Some were key-driven, others required a
                    rotating drum to enter sums punched into a keyboard, and later the drum was spun by electric
                    motor.</p>

                <h2>Mathematics</h2>
                <p><em><b>Mathematics</b></em> (from Greek: μάθημα, máthēma, 'knowledge, study, learning') includes the
                    study of such
                    topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change
                    (mathematical analysis). It has no generally accepted definition.

                    Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or
                    falsity of such by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real
                    phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature.
                    Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation,
                    measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical
                    mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research
                    required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

                Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since the
                pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic
                systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing
                truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a
                relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new
                scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued
                to the present day.

                    Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance,
                    and the social sciences. Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such
                    as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics (mathematics for its own
                    sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure
                    mathematics are often discovered later.</p>
